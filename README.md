songtagger
==========

This is a python songtagger code that works if you have the switching algorithm. It's called songtagger because it was initially used for the "hack-a-brain" hack-a-thon at the Parson's Institute of design on New York. so for those who are
interested in continuing with the project here is the song tagger code to be used with the logistic scoring algorithm. Enjoy.
Must have logistic scoring algorithm and csv data file for program to work. This program will work to sum up all data values from csv file to get a desired result of 'yes' or 'no' for any 
device such as a mindfles, neurosky, or any EEG. 

Install
=======

To install simply paste into python shell and were it says "_csv file location_" simply find your csv file within your computer and take the exact locatione and paste in the spot that says "_csv file locatione_".
This code is intended to sum up all scores from logistic scoring python algorithm in order to get a desired command of "yes" (1) or "no" (0) from the csv data and translate that into a command for any prgram.
Of course this one code does not doo all of that but it does sum up the list of data which you can use in the logistic scoring algoritm or any one you choose.
