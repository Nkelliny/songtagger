songtagger
==========

This is a python songtagger code that works if you have the switching algorithm. It's called songtagger because it was initially used for the "hack-a-brain" hack-a-thon at the Parson's Institute of design on New York. so for those who are
interested in continuing with the project here is the song tagger code to be used with the logistic scoring algorithm. Enjoy.
Must have logistic scoring algorithm and csv data file for program to work.
